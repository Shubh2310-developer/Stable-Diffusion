# 🖼️ Text-to-2D Image Generation using Stable Diffusion and CLIP

This project generates high-quality 2D images from text prompts using **Stable Diffusion** enhanced with **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)** for better prompt understanding and guidance.

## 🔥 Features

- Generate stunning 2D images from natural language prompts
- Uses Stable Diffusion for fast, high-quality image synthesis
- Incorporates CLIP to guide generation based on semantic understanding
- Supports custom prompts, seed control, and image resolution options
